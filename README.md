Hello! My name is Tavin Secrist, or TheSillyG00se23. I am currently a digital game student at Southwest Career and Technical Accademy. I absolutely love games, both playing and making them, I find it really fun. My favorite game is Undertale by Toby Fox. I really love the characters and music
Some of my interests in game development is the long process of how a game is made, puting an idea to life through multiple game making websites, like Unity or Gamemaker. I've made some pretty cool things in digital game. I also like how theres teamwork in it, as it allows me to meet new people and learn how to work with other people, which can help me in life
We are currenly working in Github and Unity, but, i would like to test out different game making websites, as well as some different coding websites as well, like Java.
